# ruby-calculator
Calculator made with ruby, designed for Linux
Designed and Developed by Kyle Fry, 2018

========VERSIONS=======
v1.0 (4/13/18)- Added ruby-calculator to GitHub, with basic calculator functions

=======INSTRUCTIONS=======
Ruby Calculator was designed to be used in a Linux terminal environment, but maybe one day, it will transform into a web-based application!

When initializing the program, you are assigned the task to give a value to the variable 'x'. This is the ONLY variable you use if you are performing one of the special operations (see below). To perform simple operations, use both X and Y.

=======OPERATIONS=======

Below are a list of operations included in the calculator:

SPECIAL OPERATIONS:
  sqrt: Takes the square root of x
  cbrt: Takes the cube root of x
  sin: Takes the sine of x
  cos: Takes the cosine of x
  tan: Takes the tangent point of x
  e(x): Takes e to the x power
  pyth [USES BOTH X AND Y]: Takes x and y, in relation to the pythagorean theorem, and squares them to find Z.
  common log: Takes common log to the x
  x log base [USES BOTH X AND Y]: Takes x and multiplies it by base y to find log

SIMPLE OPERATIONS:
  +: Adds x and y
  -: Subtracts x and y
  *: Multiplies x and y
  /: Divides x and y
